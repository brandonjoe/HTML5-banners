# VMX Banners Ads

### Intro
Made several banners ads for VMX using HTML, CSS, and Javascript for their 2020 Orlando veterinary convention in January 2020.  Although these banners were 100% built by me, the techniques were taught to me by someone else, and to preserve his integrity and parts of his works, I've decided to keep the source files hidden and display the works in the readme. 

### General info
Each clickable banner leads [here](https://navc.com/vmx/). All of these ads were created using [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap/), which is a lightweight javascript animation library. 

### Demos
Here are some of the sizes made for VMX.
